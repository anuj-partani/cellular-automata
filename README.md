# cellular-automata

Cellular automata (CA) are discrete computational models explored within automata theory. They are also known by various names, such as cellular spaces, tessellation automata, homogeneous structures, cellular structures, tessellation structures, and iterative arrays.
CA have been applied across diverse fields, including physics, theoretical biology, and microstructure modeling.

This repository includes Verilog simulations of various cellular automata, such as Rule 30, Rule 90, Rule 110, Rule 184, and Conway's Game of Life.
